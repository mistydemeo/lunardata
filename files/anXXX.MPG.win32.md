## Description

All of the game's FMVs, in files named an000.mpg through an067.mpg. Each file consists of an [MPEG-PS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG_program_stream) container, with one [MPEG-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-1) video stream and one stereo [MPEG-1 audio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-1#Part_3:_Audio) stream.

### Video

Each video stream is at a resolution of 640x480 in [YUV420P](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YUV) colour, and runs at 24 frames per second. The video is encoded at a constant bit rate of roughly 2 200 kb/s, which varies per-video.

### Audio

Audio is encoded as MPEG-1 layer 2 at 192 kb/s at a sample rate of 44100Hz. A few tracks (such as the intro) are in stereo, while the rest are mono.

## Tools

Because these videos are standard MPEG, they will play back in any video player.
Any software that can author MPEG-PS containers can produce compatible videos.
